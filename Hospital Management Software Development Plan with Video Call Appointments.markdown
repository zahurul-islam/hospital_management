Key tables supporting video call appointments:

| Table Name            | Description                              | Key Fields                                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Users                 | Stores user information                 | user_id, role (patient/doctor/admin), email, password (hashed), name |
| Patients              | Patient-specific data                   | patient_id, user_id, medical_history, contact_info |
| Doctors               | Doctor-specific data                    | doctor_id, user_id, specialty, availability    |
| Appointments          | Appointment details                     | appointment_id, patient_id, doctor_id, date, time, status, type (in-person/video) |
| Medical_Records       | Patient health records                  | record_id, patient_id, doctor_id, diagnosis, prescriptions, test_results |
| Telemedicine_Sessions | Video call consultation logs            | session_id, appointment_id, start_time, end_time, video_link |

- **Normalization**: Ensure data integrity.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., medical_history).
- **Indexing**: Optimize queries for appointment and session lookups.

### Security Design
- **Data Encryption**: Use AES encryption for data in transit and at rest.
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT for secure login.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC):
  - Patients: Access own records and appointments.
  - Doctors: Access assigned patients’ records.
  - Admins: Full system access.
- **Telemedicine Security**:
  - End-to-end encryption for video calls.
  - Secure storage of consultation records.
  - Robust network security to prevent breaches.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all data access and changes.

### Telemedicine Integration
